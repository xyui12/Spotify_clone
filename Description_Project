This is a personal project developed as part of my web development coursework. 
The Spotify Music Web App is a simple yet functional music player designed to allow users to stream their favorite tracks directly from their browser.
The project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and demonstrates my ability to create interactive web applications.
Features
Song List: Displays a list of available songs that users can choose from.
Play/Pause Buttons: Users can control music playback with straightforward play and stop buttons.
Live Music Streaming: The app supports streaming music, so users can listen to tracks in real-time.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used to structure the application, including the layout for the song list and player controls.
CSS: Applied to style the app and enhance its visual appearance.
JavaScript: Handles the functionality for playing and stopping music, as well as interacting with the song list.
